## Overview

Welcome to my Reading Tracker App! This is the front-end, built with React and Vite, for my personal reading tracker project. There are so many things yet to be fixed, implemented or improved so be patient.

## Features (So Far!)

- **API Rendering**: Succesfull display of data from the backend API
- **Real-time Updates**: See the book read status in real-time.
- **Charts**: Charts to display data in different ways using Chart.js (yet to add more)

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Building delightful user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that makes development a breeze.

## Work in Progress ðŸš§

This project is still in the oven! Expect frequent changes and improvements as I explore new features and enhancements.

## Current Focus

Right now, I'm working on several things, including:
- [ ] Making the app responsive.
- [ ] Enhancing the book details page.
- [ ] Charts to show reading habits.
- [ ] Resposive across different screens.
- [ ] Options to add book to favourites.


Feel free to peek around, and don't mind the mess - I'm actively tinkering.
